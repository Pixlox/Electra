# Electra

A JS rewrite of Electra, made for Pixlox's own personal use. Use as a reference, however it is possible to self host. Don't host yourself, if you don't know what you're doing.

## WIP

Electra is currently work-in-progress. I haven't even planned out this README, I haven't planned out the features too far other than full parity with Electra's C# counterpart, and I'm not even sure if I'll complete it. When the project nears it's first _full_ release, I'll update the README, if we get to that point ;)
